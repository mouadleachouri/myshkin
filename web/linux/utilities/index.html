        Gregor was still here and wasn’t thinking at all about abandoning his
        family. At the moment he was lying right there on the carpet, and no one
        who knew about his condition would’ve seriously demanded that he let the
        manager in. But Gregor wouldn’t be casually dismissed right way because
        of this small discourtesy, for which he would find an easy and suitable
        excuse later on. It seemed to Gregor that it might be far more
        reasonable to leave him in peace at the moment, instead of disturbing
        him with crying and conversation. But it was the very uncertainty which
        distressed the others and excused their behaviour.

        ‘Mr. Samsa,’ the manager was now shouting, his voice raised, ‘what’s the
        matter? You are barricading yourself in your room, answer with only a
        yes and a no, are making serious and unnecessary troubles for your
        parents, and neglecting (I mention this only incidentally) your
        commercial duties in a truly unheard of manner. I am speaking here in
        the name of your parents and your employer, and I am requesting you in
        all seriousness for an immediate and clear explanation. I am amazed. I
        am amazed. I thought I knew you as a calm, reasonable person, and now
        you appear suddenly to want to start parading around in weird moods. The
        Chief indicated to me earlier this very day a possible explanation for
        your neglect—it concerned the collection of cash entrusted to you a
        short while ago—but in truth I almost gave him my word of honour that
        this explanation could not be correct. However, now I see here your
        unimaginable pig headedness, and I am totally losing any desire to speak
        up for you in the slightest. And your position is not at all the most
        secure. Originally I intended to mention all this to you privately, but
        since you are letting me waste my time here uselessly, I don’t know why
        the matter shouldn’t come to the attention of your parents. Your
        productivity has also been very unsatisfactory recently. Of course, it’s
        not the time of year to conduct exceptional business, we recognize that,
        but a time of year for conducting no business, there is no such thing at
        all, Mr. Samsa, and such a thing must never be.’

        ‘But Mr. Manager,’ called Gregor, beside himself and in his agitation
        forgetting everything else, ‘I’m opening the door immediately, this very
        moment. A slight indisposition, a dizzy spell, has prevented me from
        getting up. I’m still lying in bed right now. But now I’m quite
        refreshed once again. I’m in the midst of getting out of bed. Just have
        patience for a short moment! Things are not going so well as I thought.
        But things are all right. How suddenly this can overcome someone! Just
        yesterday evening everything was fine with me. My parents certainly know
        that. Actually just yesterday evening I had a small premonition. People
        must have seen that in me. Why have I not reported that to the office!
        But people always think that they’ll get over sickness without having to
        stay at home. Mr.
