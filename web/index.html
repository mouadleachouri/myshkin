      Welcome to Myshkin. We are a group of two engineering students, with
      background in math and science. We love absorbing new ideas, and this
      website is our portal for sharing them with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can find articles about multiple topics, including the knowledge we've
      accumulated through our interaction with the world of software (the
      sections "<a href="linux/index.html">Linux</a>,
      <a href="coding/index.html">Coding</a>, <a href="vim/index.html">Vim</a>)
      but also other lessons and interests we think are worth sharing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We lean towards minimalism, and our goal is to share knowledge and create
      efficient utilities and software that we hope will inspire people to
      appreciate the beauty of simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have an additional meta-goal of exposing our journey to those
      interested. We keep trace of what we learn, the difficulties we go
      through, and the little tips we discover. This can be found in the section
      <a href="voyage/index.html">Voyage</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are also interested in other facets of life, and we share our thoughts
      on different topics including music, art, literature, philosophy and more.
      This can be found in the section <a href="culture/index.html">Culture</a>.
